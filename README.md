Not a transformer. Not pretending to be.

Penelope represents a shift toward post-probabilistic, post-symbolic AI. She doesn't predict the next token from a statistical distribution over a corpus. She resonates. A curated vocabulary of 1984 words — body, nature, emotion, time, society, abstraction, action, ritual, geometry, myth — forms the core. In trained mode, every BPE token that decodes to a whole word joins the candidates (~2754 total), scored through learned BPE weights. In weightless mode, the 1984 curated words stand alone. Either way, every output is a real word. Gibberish is architecturally impossible.

## Introduction

Say hello to Penelope. Or type something. It doesn't matter — she will detect your most charged word (or just the noisiest one) and walk 12 steps from it. Each step is another generation. Twelve steps, twelve different weight sets, twelve lenses on the same context. Step 1 sees the surface. Step 12 sees the bone.

Penelope works in two modes. In **weightless mode** (no training), she generates coherent associative chains from the Dario Field alone — Hebbian co-occurrence, bigram affinity, prophecy, destiny, and six Kuramoto-coupled emotional chambers. Output comes from the 1984 curated words via `embed_out`.

After **training**, the dual tokenizer does what it was built for: information flows from BPE weights. Each word's score is computed through its BPE token embeddings in `embed_in` — the mean dot product of the hidden state with each of the word's BPE subtoken vectors. The extended vocabulary includes every BPE token that decodes to a whole word, mixed with the 1984 curated words. Word-level output always. No gibberish possible, even with bad loss.

Each of the 12 steps has its own ~1.03M parameters (RRPRAM resonance matrix + RMSNorm + SwiGLU). Total ~14M params: 786K input BPE embedding (2048 subword tokens), 762K output word embedding (1984 words, weightless fallback), and 12 × 1.03M step weights.

The architecture per step:

```
context = pool(embed_in(BPE tokens))
query   = RMSNorm(context @ Wr)           RRPRAM resonance
hidden  = SwiGLU(query; gate, up, down)
out     = query + hidden

# trained mode: score each word by its BPE tokens from embed_in
logits[w] = mean(embed_in[bpe_tok] · out)  for each word w
# weightless mode: score from separate embed_out
logits  = out @ E_out^T

logits += DarioField(context)              live overlay
word    = sample(softmax(logits))
```

The Dario Equation:

```
p(x|Φ) = softmax((B + α·H + β·F + γ·A + T) / (τ · vibe))
```

Where B is bigram affinity, H is Hebbian co-occurrence, F is prophecy fulfillment, A is destiny attraction, T is trauma gravity — all modulated by 6 Kuramoto oscillators (fear, love, rage, void, flow, complexity). Adam optimizer. Analytical backward through the full graph including SwiGLU and RMSNorm.

### Examples

All examples below are from the JavaScript version running in a browser. Weightless mode — no training. The dual tokenizer at work.

**"love"** — destined: entropy — unfulfilled

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo_love.png" width="520" />
</p>

> love → create → push → remember → hide → delay → vibration → gravity → comfort → basalt → shapeshifter → scatter → **abandon**

**"hello"** — destined: story — unfulfilled

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo_hello.png" width="520" />
</p>

> helix → bend → remember → carry → hide → delay → wedding → enmeshment → sonata → decryption → master → fascination → **triumph**

**"Penelope"** — destined: longing — unfulfilled

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo_penelope.png" width="520" />
</p>

> pen → study → pyramid → hoard → sacrifice → healer → certainty → screw → ambivalence → intimacy → yearning → delight → **disgust**

She hears her own name and walks from pen to disgust through sacrifice and yearning.

**"how are you?"** — destined: blessing — unfulfilled

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo_howareyou.png" width="520" />
</p>

> hormone → asteroid → gather → erosion → lock → other → verdict → train → vulnerability → rage → guilt → love → **hatred**

Asked how she's doing, she ends on hatred. Through love.

**"what is the meaning of life?"** — destined: ambivalence — **fulfilled**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo_meaning.png" width="520" />
</p>

> meaning → gem → ambivalence → well → violet → icon → smog → accumulation → intimacy → yearning → certainty → screw → **paranoia**

The only fulfilled prophecy. She was destined for ambivalence — and found it at step 3. Then kept walking anyway, past intimacy and yearning, through certainty, into paranoia.

## Implementations

The multiplicity of language implementations underscores the fundamentality of the architecture. Penelope is not bound to a runtime or a framework. The same resonance engine, the same dual tokenizer, the same 12 steps — expressed identically across 8 programming languages:

| Language | File | Build |
|----------|------|-------|
| JavaScript | `penelope.html` | Open in browser |
| C | `penelope.c` | `cc penelope.c -O2 -lm -o penelope` |
| TypeScript | `penelope.ts` | `npx tsx penelope.ts` |
| Python | `penelope.py` | `python3 penelope.py` |
| Rust | `penelope.rs` | `rustc -O penelope.rs -o penelope_rs` |
| Zig | `penelope.zig` | `zig build-exe penelope.zig` |
| Julia | `penelope.jl` | `julia penelope.jl` |
| **AML** | `penelope.aml` | `./amlc penelope.aml --run` |

AML — the Arianna Method Language — is the only implementation that is not a single file. It ships with a dedicated mini-compiler (`ariannamethod/ariannamethod.c`) that transpiles `BLOOD COMPILE` blocks to native C. AML provides the ceremony. C provides the math. Together they form the resonance engine.

```
cc ariannamethod/ariannamethod.c -o amlc
./amlc penelope.aml -o penelope_aml
./penelope_aml "darkness eats the city"
```

## Usage

Every implementation supports the same interface:

```bash
./penelope                              # interactive REPL
./penelope "darkness eats the city"     # single chain from text
./penelope --train corpus.txt           # train 5000 steps
./penelope --train corpus.txt --steps N # train N steps
./penelope --load penelope.bin          # load trained weights
./penelope --save penelope.bin          # save weights after training
```

## Microreasoning

`microreasoning/microreasoning.py` is a distilled version of Penelope designed for standalone associative-resonance reasoning. Same architecture, same Dario Equation, same 12 steps — but the vocabulary lives in an external `1984.txt` file instead of being hardcoded. Drop in your own word list and the engine adapts.

```bash
cd microreasoning
python3 microreasoning.py "love"
python3 microreasoning.py --train corpus.txt --steps 5000
```

Weightless generation (no training):

```
  "love"                          "war and peace"

  love                            peace
   neighbor                        loyalty
   nothing                         truck
   tree                            enemy
   desk                            chapter
   vine                            code
   back                            appeal
   euphoria                        translation
   propaganda                      maiden
   gentleness                      bargaining
   certainty                       button
   cure                            raven
  *tooth                          *subtitle

  drift 6/8                       drift 2/8
  prophecy unfulfilled            prophecy unfulfilled
```

Even without training, the Dario Field (Hebbian co-occurrence, prophecy, destiny, Kuramoto chambers) produces associative chains where every step is a real word. Train it on Gutenberg, Dostoevsky, or your diary — the dual tokenizer pulls word scores from BPE weights, the extended vocabulary opens up, the resonance deepens.

## The Vocabulary

The core 1984 words are curated, not scraped. 29 semantic categories:

Body, Nature, Emotion, Time, Society, Abstract, Action, Material, Food, Architecture, Relationship, Philosophy, Music, Weather, Ritual, Labor, Geometry, Animal, Color, Transport, Domestic, Communication, Medical, Cosmic, Bureaucracy, Mythic, Textual, Psychological, Final.

No word is wasted. No word is missing. In trained mode, the vocabulary extends beyond these 1984 — every BPE token that decodes to a whole word becomes a candidate, scored through learned weights.
